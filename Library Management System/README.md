I Created a Library Mangement System using React + Vite

This documentation outlines the functionality and structure of a book application designed to facilitate browsing, adding, 
and viewing books. The application consists of multiple pages including the Home Page, Browse Books Page, Book Details Page,
 Add Book Page, and a 404 Error Page.

 Features
 1) The Home Page features a warm welcome message for users.
 2) It displays a list of book categories (e.g., Fiction, Non-Fiction, Sci-Fi) for easy navigation.
 3) Users can view a list of books filtered by selected categories.
 4) Each book in the list includes a "View Details" link that routes to the Book Details page.
 5) A search bar is provided to filter books by title or author for improved user experience.
 6) A form allows users to input details for adding a new book to the library.
